## Overview

XANESNET is a Python codebase for machine-learning simulation and analysis of structure-spectra relationships. It was originally developed for, but is not limited to, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra.
The current version mainly supports the forward prediction workflow from structure to spectra: train models on structures and spectra, run checkpointed inference, and analyze prediction outputs.

- **Supported now:** forward mapping from molecular or periodic structural inputs to spectra.
- **Planned later:** reverse mapping from spectra back to properties or structural information.

The project provides a suite of architectures and training strategies: from simple descriptor-based neural networks to more advanced invariant and equivariant graph neural networks.
The main goal of this work is to make machine-learning research in spectroscopy more accessible, reproducible, extendable, and comparable. This should ultimately support faster research progress and the development of new, more accurate, and explainable ML models for spectra prediction.

## Highlights

- Command-line workflows for forward-model training, checkpointed inference, and prediction analysis.
- Interactive browser-based config editor in [tools/config-ui/](tools/config-ui/).
- GPLv3 licensed open-source distribution.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
- Python **3.12** (the current known-working environment uses Python **3.12.9**)
- A C/C++ build toolchain if pip needs to compile native PyTorch Geometric extensions
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU and CUDA-compatible PyTorch wheels for `device: cuda`

### Install XANESNET

Install from a local checkout with the project metadata in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml):

From the XANESNET directory:
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -e .
```

For a non-editable install, use:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

After installation, the `xanesnet` command should be available:

```bash
xanesnet --help
```

### PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric

XANESNET depends on PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric native extensions. CPU-only Linux installs may work with plain pip resolution. For CUDA installs, or if `torch-scatter`, `torch-sparse`, or `torch-cluster` cannot find wheels automatically, install wheels matching your Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions first.

Example for PyTorch 2.5 with CUDA 12.4:

```bash
python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
python -m pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.1+cu124.html
python -m pip install -e .
```

Adjust the wheel URLs for your target platform. The PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric installation guides are the source of truth for the current compatibility matrix.

### Developer and Docs Extras

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"   # build and test tooling
python -m pip install -e ".[docs]"  # documentation tooling
```

[frozen.txt](frozen.txt) is kept as a pinned snapshot of one known-working environment. Use it only when you need to reproduce that exact environment; normal installs should use [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

## Config UI

The config UI in [tools/config-ui/](tools/config-ui/) is an interactive React editor for XANESNET `train`, `infer`, and `analyze` YAML files. It is useful both as a guided config builder and as a browsable reference for valid options in the current forward workflow.

It provides:

- Mode-specific forms for Train, Infer, and Analyze workflows.
- YAML import with automatic mode detection.
- Inference `signature.yaml` import for checkpoint-aware infer configs.
- Live YAML preview with defaults materialized and top-level sections ordered for readability.
- Schema-backed defaults and object-shape validation for datasource, dataset, model, runner, strategy, and analysis choices.

Run it locally:

```bash
cd tools/config-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local URL, usually `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` or the next free port. Save the generated YAML into [configs/](configs/) or another working directory, then pass it to the CLI.

For supported descriptor workflows, keep `dataset.mode: forward`. Reverse-mode configuration is not part of the current documented workflow and is planned for a later stage.

Common config UI commands:

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the Vite development server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run build    # Type-check and build production assets into dist/
npm run preview  # Preview the production build locally
```

More details are in [tools/config-ui/README.md](tools/config-ui/README.md).

## Usage

XANESNET runs are driven by YAML configuration files. The supported workflow today is forward XANES prediction: prepare structure/spectrum data, train a model, infer spectra with a saved checkpoint, and analyze prediction files. Examples live in [configs/](configs/), including [configs/in_mlp.yaml](configs/in_mlp.yaml), [configs/in_mlp_infer.yaml](configs/in_mlp_infer.yaml), and [configs/analyze_example.yaml](configs/analyze_example.yaml).

### Train

```bash
xanesnet train \
    -i configs/in_mlp.yaml \
    -n mlp_test \
    -t \
    -y
```

Training outputs are written under `runs/<timestamp>_train_<name>/`. Typical outputs include the copied raw config, validated and resolved configs, split indices, checkpoint signatures, checkpoints, final model weights, logs, and optional TensorBoard files.

Use `--dry-run` with `xanesnet train` to construct the normal training pipeline, run one real epoch, and write `model_profile.json` with the model architecture, parameter counts, model size, and peak CUDA memory for that epoch when CUDA is available.

### Infer

```bash
xanesnet infer \
    -i configs/in_mlp_infer.yaml \
    -m runs/<train_run>/models/final.pth \
    -n mlp_infer \
    -y
```

Inference configs are strictly merged with the checkpoint signature saved during training. If a user-provided value conflicts with the signature, inference fails early. The merged and validated configs are saved in the new inference run directory, and predictions are written under `predictions/`.

### Analyze

```bash
xanesnet analyze \
    -i configs/analyze_example.yaml \
    -p runs/<infer_run>/predictions \
    -n mlp_analysis \
    -y
```

The `-p` option can be supplied multiple times when comparing or aggregating predictions from several inference runs.

### Python Entry Point

For scripts and notebooks, you can call the same dispatcher that backs the CLI:

```python
from xanesnet.cli import main

main(["train", "-i", "configs/in_mlp.yaml", "-n", "mlp_test", "-y"])
```

For most workflows, the installed `xanesnet` command is the recommended interface because it keeps command logging and run directories consistent.

## Configuration

Configuration validation and defaults are implemented with packaged JSON Schema files:

- [xanesnet/serialization/config.py](xanesnet/serialization/config.py)
- [xanesnet/serialization/schema_validation.py](xanesnet/serialization/schema_validation.py)
- [xanesnet/schemas/](xanesnet/schemas/)

At a high level, a config contains:

- `seed` and `device`
- `datasource`: input structure and spectrum source
- `dataset`: preprocessing, storage, split, and descriptor or graph settings; use `mode: forward` for supported descriptor workflows
- `model`: model family and hyperparameters
- exactly one runner section: `trainer`, `inferencer`, or analysis settings depending on workflow
- `strategy`: single model or ensemble training/inference behavior

The config UI reads the same schemas through [tools/config-ui/src/schemas](tools/config-ui/src/schemas), a symlink to [xanesnet/schemas/](xanesnet/schemas/).
