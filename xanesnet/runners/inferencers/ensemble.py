class EnsembleInferencer(Inferencer):
    """Inferencer for multiple independently trained models.

    Runs a single data loader and evaluates every ensemble member on each
    batch. Member predictions are post-processed with the configured batch
    processor, stacked along a model dimension, and reduced to a mean
    prediction plus an energy/channel-wise standard deviation. Per-member
    spectra are not persisted.

    ``model_device_policy`` controls how member models are placed on the
    inference device. ``"all"`` keeps every model on the device for faster
    inference when the ensemble fits in memory. ``"sequential"`` moves one
    model at a time to the device, copies its prepared predictions back to CPU,
    and then moves the model back to CPU before evaluating the next member.

    Args:
        dataset: Dataset to run inference on.
        models: Non-empty list of models to evaluate.
        device: Device identifier or :class:`torch.device` instance.
        batch_size: Number of samples per inference batch.
        shuffle: Whether to shuffle the data.
        drop_last: Whether to drop the last incomplete batch.
        num_workers: Number of data-loader worker processes.
        inferencer_type: Identifier string for this inferencer type.
        buffer_size: Number of absorber rows buffered before prediction data is
            flushed to disk.
        model_device_policy: Device-placement policy for ensemble members.
            Supported values are ``"all"`` and ``"sequential"``.
