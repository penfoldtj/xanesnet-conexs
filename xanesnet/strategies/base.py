    A strategy defines how one or more models are set up, trained, and used for
    inference (e.g. single model, deep ensemble, snapshot ensemble, bootstrap).
    Subclasses must implement all abstract methods to provide concrete training
    and inference logic.

    Args:
        strategy_type: Registry key identifying this strategy type.
        dataset: The dataset used for training or inference.
        model_config: Configuration for the model.
        weight_init: Weight initialization scheme name.
        weight_init_params: Additional parameters passed to the weight initializer.
        bias_init: Bias initialization scheme name.
        checkpoint_dir: Directory for saving checkpoint files, or
            ``None`` to disable checkpointing.
        checkpoint_interval: Number of epochs between checkpoints, or
            ``None`` to disable interval-based checkpointing.
        tensorboard_dir: Directory for TensorBoard event files, or
            ``None`` to disable TensorBoard logging.
        trainer_config: Configuration for the trainer. Either this or
            ``inferencer_config`` must be provided.
        inferencer_config: Configuration for the inferencer. Either this
            or ``trainer_config`` must be provided.
